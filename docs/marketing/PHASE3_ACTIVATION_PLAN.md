# Phase 3 Integration Activation Plan

The Phase 3 deliverables (LangChain/LlamaIndex tools, GitHub Action, Slack `/ato` command) are now live. This plan ensures they achieve adoption targets during Phase 4.

## Goals (First 90 Days)
- 500 combined installs/downloads across Python toolkit, GitHub Action, Slack app.
- 30 published community recipes referencing at least one integration.
- 50% of new timers created via integrations include region hints.

## Tactics
1. **Hero Tutorials**
   - Record end-to-end video for each integration showing regional failover and jitter telemetry.
   - Publish annotated notebooks + repo links; embed `pip install`/`uses: domusgpt/minoots-timer-system/github-actions/schedule-timer@v1` snippets.
2. **Co-marketing**
   - Coordinate with LangChain and LlamaIndex community teams for newsletter mentions.
   - Submit GitHub Action to Marketplace featured queue; gather 5-star reviews from beta users.
3. **Slack Workspace Pilot**
   - Seed the `/ato` command in 5 targeted communities (e.g., AgentOps Founders, Builder Hub). Provide quickstart doc + admin install checklist.
4. **Instrumentation**
   - Add Mixpanel events for `integration_invoked` with metadata `source=langchain|llamaindex|github_action|slack_bot`.
   - Track success/failure outcomes to inform follow-up content.
5. **Office Hours**
   - Weekly "Integration Lab" session where engineers debug user setups live.

## Messaging Hooks
- "Timers in your notebook, pipeline, or chatâ€”pick your vibe."
- Emphasize multi-region reliability and signed envelopes as differentiators.
- Highlight community testimonials and early adopter quotes in social proof banners.

## KPIs & Reporting
- Dashboard live in Looker Studio pulling from Mixpanel + GitHub Marketplace.
- Weekly slack update summarizing installs, active usage, and top support issues.
- Retro at Day 45 to double down on highest converting channels.
