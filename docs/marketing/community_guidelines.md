# Vibe Coding Community Guidelines

Welcome to the MINOOTS vibe coding collective. We host two public homes—Discord and Reddit—plus private beta channels for launch partners. These guidelines keep the rhythm tight and the collaboration high-signal.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Keep the beat:** Stay constructive and on-topic. Help teams ship resilient async workflows.
2. **Share the stage:** Invite diverse voices. Credit original work and link sources.
3. **No feedback loops of doom:** Call out outages, bugs, or security issues responsibly (DM moderators or email security@minoots.com).
4. **Privacy first:** Never post API keys, tenant IDs, or sensitive logs. Use redacted snippets.
5. **Moderation as mentorship:** Mods are "Beat Conductors"—they facilitate, not police. Assume good intent, then clarify.

## Channel Taxonomy (Discord)
- `#announcements` – Launches, roadmap beats, maintenance windows. Read-only.
- `#show-and-tell` – Demos, automations, and agent recipes.
- `#help-desk` – Support questions with SLA <4h during launch week.
- `#vibe-lab` – Experiments, research threads, co-creation sessions.
- `#offbeat` – Culture, memes, rhythm swaps.
- `#mod-backstage` – Private space for moderation notes and escalations.
- `#ecosystem-signal` – Cross-post spotlights from Parserator, Reposiologist, Nimbus Guardian, and Clear Seas Solutions consulting updates.

## Weekly Cadence
- **Monday:** Mod sync (15 min) reviewing flagged items and upcoming events.
- **Wednesday:** Office hours livestream with rotating product + eng hosts.
- **Friday:** Community recap thread + call for next week's demos.
- **Monthly:** "Open Jam" AMA featuring customer stories + roadmap updates.
- **Quarterly:** Ecosystem town hall with Parserator data scientists, Reposiologist auditors, and Nimbus Guardian security coaches.

## Moderation Workflow
1. **Triage:** Use `/flag` (Discord bot) or Reddit mod queue to collect reports.
2. **Respond:** Acknowledge reporter within 2 hours; decide severity.
3. **Resolve:** Apply actions (warn, timeout, ban) and log in `#mod-backstage` with timestamp + link.
4. **Retro:** Capture learnings in the monthly Open Jam deck.
