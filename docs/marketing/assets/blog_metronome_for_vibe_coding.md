# MINOOTS: The Metronome for Vibe Coding

*Published: Week 1 — Phase 4 Launch*

When your build energy is high, nothing kills the vibe faster than a timer that disappears because a process crashed or a region hiccuped. MINOOTS was built to make that fear obsolete.

## Why Flow Needs a Metronome
- **Autonomous agents need consistency.** Claude, LangChain, and LlamaIndex flows expect external triggers to fire exactly when promised.
- **Teams need trust.** Product ops, reliability engineering, and growth squads cannot babysit cronjobs. They need contracts.
- **Creators need pace.** Whether you are streaming on Twitch or automating your company’s onboarding, the rhythm matters.

## The Infrastructure Behind the Beat
1. **Multi-region kernel gateway** with failover ensures requests land in the healthiest region without manual intervention.
2. **Signed event envelopes** carry tamper-proof payloads through gRPC, JetStream, and Slack so you can audit every beat.
3. **Jitter-aware scheduling** keeps timers honest by measuring drift and compensating in real-time.
4. **Agent-native integrations** (LangChain tool, LlamaIndex FunctionTool, GitHub Action, Slack `/ato`) let timers live where you work.

## Build Along: 3 Steps to Your First Vibe-Proof Timer
```bash
pip install minoots-agent-tools
```
```python
from minoots_agent_tools.langchain import AtoTimerTool

tool = AtoTimerTool()
result = tool.run({
    "name": "launch_ph_watch",
    "duration": "15m",
    "labels": {"campaign": "vibe-launch"},
    "preferred_regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1"],
})
print(result)
```
```yaml
# .github/workflows/vibe-launch.yml
name: Vibe Launch

  workflow_dispatch:

          duration: "2h"
          preferred_regions: "us-central1,europe-west1"
          webhook_url: ${{ secrets.LAUNCH_RECAP_URL }}
```

## What’s Next
- Join the **Discord** to share your timer recipes and win exclusive swag.
- Add the **Slack `/ato`** command to your workspace and trigger follow-ups without leaving chat.
- Watch the **live stream** on Thursday for a failover demo and Q&A with the horology engineering team.

Let’s keep your agents (and your team) on tempo.
