# Clear Seas Solutions Portfolio Operating Model

This playbook describes how MINOOTS timers, Parserator parsing flows, Reposiologist audits, and Nimbus Guardian guardrails combine into a Parse → Plan → Ship rhythm under the Clear Seas Solutions banner.

## Parserator — Structured Data Ingestion
- **Source:** https://parserator.com/
- **Superpowers:** Architect/extractor pattern, 95%+ structured JSON, customizable datasets, autopilot modes.
- **Integration hooks:**
  - Tag MINOOTS timers with `ecosystem.parserator/*` metadata when architect/extractor workspaces publish new datasets.
  - Use Parserator confidence scores to determine timer escalation policies (manual review vs. autonomous follow-up).
  - Share weekly "dataset premieres" where Parserator scientists showcase new recipes and publish timer templates in Discord.

## Reposiologist — Repository Intelligence
- **Source:** https://reposiologist-beta.web.app/
- **Superpowers:** Clause Code plugin, repo sweep cadences, audit focus presets, automation packaging.
- **Integration hooks:**
  - Schedule MINOOTS timers for each Clause Code sprint to coordinate code review pods and follow-up tasks.
  - Label timers with `ecosystem.reposiologist/cadence` so analytics can track daily, weekly, or monthly sweep velocity.
  - Pair repo insights with Nimbus Guardian guardrails before triggering deployments.

## Nimbus Guardian — Deployment Safety Net
- **Source:** https://nimbus-guardian.web.app/
- **Superpowers:** <5 second secret scanning, tool detection, dual AI explainers (Claude + Gemini), Docker and Firebase validation.
- **Integration hooks:**
  - Require Nimbus Guardian policy IDs (`ecosystem.nimbusGuardian/policy`) on timers that gate staging → production handoffs.
  - Trigger Nimbus follow-up scans immediately after Parserator or Reposiologist workflows surface risky changes.
  - Showcase monthly guardrail drills in the community to maintain readiness and demonstrate dual AI explainers.

## Clear Seas Solutions — Portfolio Narrative
- **Source:** https://domusgpt.github.io/ClearSeas-Enhanced/
- **Superpowers:** Consultancy positioning, maritime-grade rigor, cross-product storytelling.
- **Integration hooks:**
  - Map client pods and service tiers to MINOOTS timers via `ecosystem.clearSeas/*` labels for account-level insights.
  - Host quarterly "salon" sessions featuring Parse → Plan → Ship wins and publishing recap posts on the Clear Seas site.
  - Align newsletter and PR cadences with timer analytics to demonstrate measurable impact across the portfolio.

## Operational Cadence
1. **Parse:** Parserator ingestion clinics publish dataset updates and raise MINOOTS timers for downstream teams.
2. **Plan:** Reposiologist Clause Code sprints and Clear Seas pod rituals consume timer events to coordinate audits and content.
3. **Ship:** Nimbus Guardian guardrails validate deployments while MINOOTS automates escalations and multi-region follow-through.
4. **Reflect:** Portfolio analytics (Amplitude, Looker Studio) leverage `ecosystem.*` labels to surface ROI, adoption, and next best actions.

## Success Metrics
- Parserator dataset adoption measured by timers labeled with new workspace IDs within 48 hours of release.
- Reposiologist sweep completion rate driven by timers carrying Clause Code cadence labels.
- Nimbus Guardian policy adherence tracked by the percentage of production timers with enforced guardrails.
- Clear Seas Solutions client satisfaction measured through cadence of salon recaps and timer-driven follow-up completion.
