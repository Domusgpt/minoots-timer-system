# Wave 1 Day 1 â€“ Governance & Resilience

## Highlights
- Control plane wrapped with RBAC + quota middleware, signed gRPC metadata, and Connect-ready server.
- Kernel persists command log to Postgres, replays on boot, and enforces leadership via Raft supervisor scaffold.
- Action orchestrator exposes Prometheus metrics and retry-aware executor pipeline.
- Added Wave 1 integration harness (REST + gRPC + JetStream) and chaos tooling for restart/latency drills.

## Risks
- Raft supervisor currently single-node only; multi-node consensus deferred to Phase 2.
- JetStream event parsing may vary across action bundles; schema registry expansion required.
- Integration harness depends on live stack; CI automation needs container orchestration.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out schema registry with agent prompt & workflow connectors plus contract tests.
- Automate harness execution in CI once services can boot in pipeline environment.
- Expand chaos suite with packet loss + database failover once replicas are available.
