# 2025-10-15 Devlog (Wave 0 Day 0)

## Highlights
- Async refactor charter consolidated into a single execution program with DevTrack alignment.
- Established repo-wide devlog and testing system policies.

## Stream Updates
### Control Plane (CP)
- Yesterday: Legacy Express-based plan without persistence backlog.
- Today: Create tickets `CP-PERSIST-01` (Postgres adapter) and `CP-OTEL-01` (middleware). Draft ADR on Fastify migration.
- Risks / Blockers: Need decision on ORM (Prisma vs. Drizzle) before implementation.
- Telemetry Links: _(to be captured after OTEL collector bootstrap)_

### Horology Kernel (HK)
- Yesterday: In-memory scheduler blueprint without replication path.
- Today: Scope `HK-PERSIST-01` (command log trait) and `HK-RAFT-01` (leader election research). Outline timing wheel module structure.
- Risks / Blockers: Awaiting consensus on persistence substrate (FoundationDB vs. Postgres logical). Research owner not yet assigned.
- Telemetry Links: _(collector setup pending)_

### Execution Mesh (EM)
- Yesterday: Webhook-focused orchestrator design.
- Today: Define `EM-JETSTREAM-01` for JetStream bootstrap and `EM-PLUGINS-01` for connector SDK skeleton.
- Risks / Blockers: JetStream local deployment script missing.
- Telemetry Links: _(pending)_

### Developer Experience (DX)
- Yesterday: No shared devlog/testing process.
- Today: Publish `docs/DEVLOG_AND_TESTING_SYSTEM.md`, plan docker-compose for Postgres + JetStream + OTEL collector, and sketch CI devlog check.
- Risks / Blockers: Need GitHub Actions permissions for new workflows.
- Telemetry Links: _(pending)_

### Governance
- Yesterday: Governance strategy distributed across docs.
- Today: Tag `GOV-AUDIT-01` (signed envelope ledger) and `GOV-RBAC-01` (policy wall). Schedule compliance review cadence.
- Risks / Blockers: Tooling selection for audit ledger (OpenSearch vs. Postgres) undecided.
- Telemetry Links: _(pending)_

## Testing Summary
- ⚠️ command `npm test` (deferred until service changes begin)
- ⚠️ command `cargo test` (deferred until persistence adapters available)
- ⚠️ command `npm run test:e2e` (blocked: JetStream docker-compose not yet provisioned)

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Decision: Adopt devlog/test charter as default repo policy (owner: DX lead, due: 2025-10-17).
- Follow-up: Draft ADR on persistence substrate trade-offs (owner: HK lead, due: 2025-10-20).
- Follow-up: Prepare GitHub Actions plan for devlog enforcement (owner: DX, due: 2025-10-18).
