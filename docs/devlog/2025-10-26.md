# 2025-10-26 Devlog (Wave 2 Day 1)

## Highlights
- Delivered jitter-aware scheduling in the horology kernel, persisting `jitter_ms` and feeding a compensation hint back into new timers (HK-TEMP-21).
- Exposed the `/timers/stream` SSE endpoint backed by the kernel gRPC feed so agents can subscribe to live timer state changes (CP-STREAM-07).
- Added a streaming helper to the Node SDK and documented the end-to-end workflow for Wave 2 contributors (DX-SDK-18).
- Introduced the Agent Command Bus connectors (MCP, LangChain, AutoGen, Webhook v2, Custom) with acknowledgement telemetry (EM-CBUS-10).

## Stream Updates
### Control Plane (CP)
- Yesterday: Wrapped Wave 1 by documenting the JetStream integration harness.
- Today: Plumbed the kernel event stream into `/timers/stream` with SSE semantics and wired jitter fields through the repositories.
- Risks / Blockers: Need follow-up to authorize cross-tenant streaming subscriptions once RBAC policy wall lands (CP-POLICY-09).
- Telemetry Links: `npm --prefix apps/control-plane test`.

### Horology Kernel (HK)
- Yesterday: Finished the JetStream harness to close Wave 1.
- Today: Added the `JitterMonitor` to compute rolling averages, persisted `jitter_ms`, and exposed the metric via gRPC + Postgres.
- Risks / Blockers: Evaluate how the jitter compensation behaves under high load during Wave 2 chaos drills (HK-TEMP-23).
- Telemetry Links: `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`.

### Execution Mesh (EM)
- Yesterday: Waiting on kernel harness validation.
- Today: Wired the Agent Command Bus connectors and progress callbacks into the orchestrator so agent_prompt actions surface acknowledgements.
- Risks / Blockers: Need contract tests per connector family when real integrations land (EM-CBUS-11).
- Telemetry Links: `_covered by orchestrator dev logs_`.

### Developer Experience (DX)
- Yesterday: Documented JetStream harness usage.
- Today: Updated the local environment guide with streaming + jitter workflows and added the SDK streaming example.
- Risks / Blockers: Publish sandbox tutorial once Wave 2 demo content is ready (DX-SANDBOX-05).
- Telemetry Links: `_docs update_`.

### Governance
- Yesterday: No new updates.
- Today: Confirmed signed envelopes propagate through the SSE stream so audit consumers can verify authenticity downstream (GOV-AUDIT-07).
- Risks / Blockers: Coordinate with policy wall team on tenant-scoped stream access checks.
- Telemetry Links: `_n/a_`.

## Testing Summary
- ✅ command `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`
- ✅ command `npm --prefix apps/control-plane test`

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Decision: Apply rolling jitter compensation to keep timer drift under ±500 ms without overshooting near-term schedules (owner: HK platform, logged 2025-10-26).
- Follow-up: Backfill jitter metrics into OTEL once Wave 2 observability stories kick off (owner: HK telemetry, due 2025-10-29).
- Follow-up: Add connector-specific contract tests once real MCP and LangChain sandboxes are available (owner: EM integrations, due 2025-11-05).
