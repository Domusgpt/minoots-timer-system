# 2025-10-26 Devlog (Wave 2 Day 1)

## Highlights
- Landed temporal graph and jitter primitives in the horology kernel, including restart-aware graph restoration and new unit coverage (HK-GRAPH-01).
- Extended the control plane with temporal graph/jitter persistence plus SSE & WebSocket streaming endpoints for timer envelopes (CP-STREAM-02).
- Introduced the agent command bus connectors and SDK streaming helper so downstream agents can consume live timer events (EM-AGENT-03).

## Stream Updates
### Control Plane (CP)
- Yesterday: Stabilized Wave 1 JetStream harness documentation.
- Today: Added migration `0005_wave2_temporal_graphs`, surfaced graph/jitter metadata through the gRPC gateway, and shipped authenticated SSE/WS streaming routes (CP-STREAM-02).
- Risks / Blockers: Monitor resource usage for long-lived SSE clients; add retry/backoff guidance in SDK follow-up.
- Telemetry Links: `npm test` (apps/control-plane).

### Horology Kernel (HK)
- Yesterday: Completed JetStream integration harness for Wave 1 closure.
- Today: Implemented `TemporalGraphExecutor`, `JitterMonitor`, and restart-safe follow-up scheduling with accompanying tests (HK-GRAPH-01).
- Risks / Blockers: Need additional integration coverage for jitter-compensated offsets once real latency data is available.
- Telemetry Links: `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`.

### Execution Mesh (EM)
- Yesterday: Awaited Wave 2 kernel primitives to unblock agent orchestration.
- Today: Added the agent command bus with MCP/LangChain/AutoGen/Webhook connectors and verified progress callbacks in unit tests (EM-AGENT-03).
- Risks / Blockers: Wire real connector implementations before production enablement; ensure back-pressure handling on progress streams.
- Telemetry Links: `npm test` (services/action-orchestrator).

### Developer Experience (DX)
- Yesterday: Documented JetStream harness usage for Wave 1 exit.
- Today: Updated `.env.example` and `LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` with Wave 2 streaming instructions, migration reminders, and SDK notes (DX-ENV-15).
- Risks / Blockers: None.
- Telemetry Links: `_docs update only_`.

### Governance
- Yesterday: Confirmed HMAC envelope authenticity for JetStream.
- Today: Logged Wave 2 feature completion in the implementation log, highlighting new metadata persisted for audit trails (GOV-AUDIT-07).
- Risks / Blockers: Establish retention policies for temporal graph JSON once analytics needs are finalized.
- Telemetry Links: `_n/a_`.

## Testing Summary
- ✅ command `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`
- ✅ command `npm test` *(apps/control-plane)*
- ✅ command `npm test` *(services/action-orchestrator)*

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Decision: Require `npm run db:migrate` after pulling Wave 2 to ensure graph/jitter columns exist in local Postgres (owner: CP platform, logged 2025-10-26).
- Follow-up: Add jitter analytics dashboards once enough samples are collected (owner: HK platform, due 2025-11-05).
- Follow-up: Implement reconnect/backoff in the SDK SSE helper (owner: DX/SDK, due 2025-10-29).
