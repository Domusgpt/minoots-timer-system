# 2025-10-24 Devlog (Wave 1 Day 10)

## Highlights
- Refactored the kernel JetStream forwarder behind an injectable client and added unit coverage that exercises the publish loop without a live NATS dependency (HK-EVT-12).
- Verified the forwarder still logs stream discovery and ack failures while keeping the real connection alive during runtime (HK-OBS-06).
- Kept the Wave 1 persistence and replication suites green after the forwarder refactor (HK-TEST-05).

## Stream Updates
### Control Plane (CP)
- Yesterday: Validated JetStream payload schema alignment with gRPC envelopes.
- Today: Confirmed forwarder refactor preserves envelope structure so policy wall ingestion remains unblocked (CP-AUDIT-05).
- Risks / Blockers: Need policy wall UI to surface JetStream envelope metadata before Wave 1 freeze.
- Telemetry Links: `_n/a (backend-only refactor)_`.

### Horology Kernel (HK)
- Yesterday: Published signed envelopes into JetStream.
- Today: Added a `JetStreamClient` abstraction and recording test to assert envelopes are serialized and published when the broadcast channel emits events (HK-EVT-12).
- Risks / Blockers: Follow up with an end-to-end JetStream integration harness that runs against an ephemeral NATS server (HK-TEST-09).
- Telemetry Links: `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`.

### Execution Mesh (EM)
- Yesterday: Verified envelope signatures manually on JetStream deliveries.
- Today: Awaiting kernel integration harness so orchestrator JetStream tests can re-enable automated verification (EM-SEC-07).
- Risks / Blockers: Need mocked JetStream or dockerized NATS in CI to restore orchestrator test coverage.
- Telemetry Links: `_pending harness work_`.

### Developer Experience (DX)
- Yesterday: Documented JetStream envelope configuration in local guide.
- Today: Captured the forwarder testing approach in the implementation log for Wave 1 contributors (DX-ENV-13).
- Risks / Blockers: Still need bootstrap script to generate envelope secrets automatically.
- Telemetry Links: `_docs update only_`.

### Governance
- Yesterday: Confirmed JetStream publishing satisfies authenticity requirements.
- Today: No new governance updates; awaiting automated secret rotation tooling (GOV-AUDIT-06).
- Risks / Blockers: Rotation plan still outstanding ahead of Wave 1 freeze.
- Telemetry Links: `_n/a_`.

## Testing Summary
- ✅ command `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ command `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Decision: Wrap JetStream forwarding behind a testable client abstraction so the kernel can enforce publish contracts without requiring live infrastructure (owner: HK platform, logged 2025-10-24).
- Follow-up: Build an integration harness that spins up a temporary NATS JetStream server and validates envelopes end-to-end (owner: HK platform, due 2025-10-27).
- Follow-up: Extend orchestrator CI to consume the forwarder’s recorded payloads once the integration harness is available (owner: EM platform, due 2025-10-28).
