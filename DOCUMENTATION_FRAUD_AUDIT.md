### 21. README.md  
**Status**: üîÑ NEEDS RE-CORRECTION
**Created**: January 13, 2025
**CORRECTION ERROR**: I incorrectly removed implemented features as "fake"
**What I wrongly called fake but actually exists AS CODE** (but may not be configured):
- Pricing structures: $19/month Pro, $49/month Team (CODE exists but Stripe setup unknown)
- MCP integration: Complete 8-tool MCP server exists at /mcp/index.js (WORKING)
- Node.js SDK: Full SDK implementation at /sdk/minoots-sdk.js (WORKING)
- Tier-based features: Usage limits coded in usageTracking.js (but depends on payment system)
- Payment processing: Stripe integration code exists (but actual Stripe account/setup unknown)
- Usage analytics: Daily/monthly tracking code exists (but not verified working)
- Billing portal: Customer management code exists (but no real Stripe account confirmed)
- Enterprise features: Many planned in strategic roadmap, not fictional
**What may actually be fake**:
- Specific URLs like "minoots.com/signup" (domain existence unverified)
- Support email addresses (existence unverified)
- Status page URLs (existence unverified)
- Contact phone numbers (existence unverified)
**Correction Started**: January 13, 2025 - 22:50 UTC  
**Major Correction Error Identified**: January 13, 2025 - 23:15 UTC
**Reality Check Required**: Verified via direct code examination - many features ARE implemented

## üìù CORRECTION PROTOCOL

### When Correcting Each Document:
1. **Timestamp the correction start**
2. **List specific lies being removed**
3. **Document what verified reality replaces them**
4. **Timestamp the correction completion**
5. **Mark document status as ‚úÖ CORRECTED**

### Example Correction Entry:
```
### BACKUP_RECOVERY.md - CORRECTION LOG
**Correction Started**: January 13, 2025 - 23:00 UTC
**Lies Removed**:

## üö® CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL FUTURE DOCUMENTATION

1. **NO FAKE CONTACT INFO** - No phone numbers, emails, or support addresses unless they actually exist
2. **NO FAKE PRICING** - No monetary amounts, subscription tiers, or service costs unless agreed upon
3. **NO FAKE INFRASTRUCTURE** - Only describe systems that actually exist and are deployed
4. **NO FAKE GUARANTEES** - No SLAs, uptime promises, or performance claims unless verified
5. **NO FAKE COMPLIANCE** - No certification claims unless we actually have the certifications
6. **TIMESTAMP ALL CHANGES** - Every edit must be logged with date/time
7. **VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING** - Every technical claim must be verified against actual deployed system

---

**NEXT ACTION**: Begin systematic audit and correction of each document, starting with most critical lies.
