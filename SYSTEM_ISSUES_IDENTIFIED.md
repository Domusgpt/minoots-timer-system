## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: Webhook Authentication Blocking Timer Webhooks

### **Problem**
The webhook bridge is rejecting MINOOTS API webhook calls because they're unauthenticated:
```
2025-07-14T13:44:01.357624Z W webhook: The request was not authenticated. 
Either allow unauthenticated invocations or set the proper Authorization header.
```

### **Root Cause**
Firebase Functions v2 requires authentication by default. The MINOOTS API calls webhooks without auth headers, but the webhook bridge expects authentication.

### **Flow Analysis**
1. ‚úÖ Timer created successfully (ID: 14c148d0-deb8-485d-aaa6-a9561daa50d9)
2. ‚úÖ Timer expired successfully (status: "expired")
3. ‚ùå MINOOTS API called webhook but webhook rejected (unauthenticated)
4. ‚ùå No command stored in Firestore
5. ‚ùå Daemon polling empty Firestore collection (NOT_FOUND errors)

### **Solution**
Configure Firebase Functions to allow unauthenticated invocations for webhook endpoints.

## üîß NEXT STEPS
1. Fix webhook authentication to allow unauthenticated calls
2. Test webhook receives timer data successfully
3. Verify daemon picks up command from Firestore
4. Complete end-to-end flow

**Status**: Critical blocker identified - webhook authentication prevents timer webhook delivery
