# Additional Documentation Needed

**Based on verified 8 documents, what else users might actually need - BUILD FROM SCRATCH**

## ðŸš¨ DO NOT USE OLD DOCS - BUILD FRESH

The old docs/ folder contains the same hallucinated bullshit I was creating. If we build these, start from ZERO and verify against actual code.

## ðŸ“‹ POTENTIALLY USEFUL ADDITIONAL DOCS

### For Developers
- **ERROR_HANDLING.md** - How to handle 400/401/403/429/500 responses properly
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - How to deploy/configure the system in production
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions (based on real user problems)

### For AI Agent Developers  
- **AGENT_PATTERNS.md** - Real patterns for AI coordination (not bullshit examples)
- **RATE_LIMIT_COORDINATION.md** - How agents should handle API limits

### For Team Administrators
- **TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step organization setup (when invite endpoint works)

### For Production Users
- **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - How to test integrations properly
- **SECURITY_GUIDE.md** - Best practices for API key management

## âœ… CURRENT 8 DOCS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR NOW

Our verified 8 documents cover:
1. **QUICK_START.md** - Getting started
2. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete API
3. **AUTHENTICATION.md** - How auth works  
4. **WEBHOOKS.md** - Integration patterns
5. **SDK_GUIDE.md** - Node.js usage
6. **MCP_INTEGRATION.md** - Claude setup
7. **TEAM_FEATURES.md** - RBAC system
8. **MONITORING.md** - Tracking/logging

## ðŸŽ¯ DECISION: STOP HERE FOR NOW

The 8 docs we have are:
- âœ… **Verified against actual code**
- âœ… **Honest about what works/doesn't work**  
- âœ… **Cover all core functionality**
- âœ… **Reference implementation backlog for missing features**

Additional docs should only be created:
1. **After bugs are fixed** (invite endpoint, MCP auth, etc.)
2. **Based on real user feedback** (not assumptions)
3. **Verified against working code** (not hallucinations)

**Status**: 8 core documents complete and verified
**Next**: Fix implementation issues before adding more docs
