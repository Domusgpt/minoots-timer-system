## üéØ DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES

### ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. **ONLY document what exists and works**  
2. **Test every example before including it**  
3. **No contact info unless emails/phones actually work**  
4. **No URLs unless they actually resolve**  
5. **No features unless code is confirmed working**  
6. **No pricing unless Stripe is actually configured**  

### QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Every curl example must work  
- Every code example must be tested  
- Every endpoint must be verified  
- Every response format must match reality  
- Every error message must be accurate  

### USER EXPERIENCE GOAL:
**Someone reads our docs ‚Üí follows examples ‚Üí everything works ‚Üí they trust us**
