  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    },
    "access": {
      "user_dev1": "manager",
      "user_dev2": "editor"
    }
  }'
```

### Project Benefits
- **Organized Timers**: Group by feature, sprint, or milestone
- **Team Coordination**: Shared visibility and collaboration
- **Permission Control**: Project-specific access levels
- **Analytics**: Project-level usage and performance metrics

## ‚è≤Ô∏è COLLABORATIVE TIMERS

### Creating Team Timers
```javascript
// Create timer within project context
const teamTimer = await fetch('https://api-m3waemr5lq-uc.a.run.app/timers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${firebaseToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Sprint Planning Session',
    duration: '2h',
    organizationId: 'org_abc123',
    projectId: 'proj_mobile_launch',
    events: {
      on_expire: {
        webhook: 'https://slack.com/webhook/dev-team',
        message: 'üèÅ Sprint planning session completed!'
      }
    }
  })
});
```

### Team Notifications
```bash
# Broadcast message to team
curl -X POST https://api-m3waemr5lq-uc.a.run.app/teams/dev-team/broadcast \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Deployment window starts in 30 minutes",
    "webhook": "https://slack.com/webhook/dev-team"
  }'
```

## üîê SECURITY & PERMISSIONS

### API Key Management
Team accounts get organization-level API keys:

```bash
# Generate team API key
curl -X POST https://api-m3waemr5lq-uc.a.run.app/account/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Team Production Key",
    "organizationId": "org_abc123",
    "permissions": ["create_timers", "manage_projects"]
  }'
```

### Permission Inheritance
- **Organization Level**: Access to all org resources
- **Project Level**: Specific project permissions
- **Timer Level**: Individual timer collaboration

### Security Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Use role-based permissions (don't make everyone Admin)
- ‚úÖ Create project-specific access when possible
- ‚úÖ Regularly audit team member access
- ‚úÖ Use separate API keys for different environments
- ‚úÖ Monitor usage analytics for unusual activity

---

## üìä USAGE ANALYTICS

### Team Dashboard
Access your team metrics:
```bash
curl -X GET https://api-m3waemr5lq-uc.a.run.app/organizations/org_abc123/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```

**Response includes:**
- Timer creation by team member
- Project activity and performance
- API usage and rate limiting
- Billing and subscription status

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Active Timers**: Current team workload
- **Completion Rates**: Project delivery performance
- **Collaboration Index**: Cross-team timer sharing
- **API Efficiency**: Response times and usage patterns

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### "Organization not found"
- **Cause**: User not added to organization
- **Fix**: Admin must invite user with proper email

#### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: User role insufficient for action
- **Fix**: Admin upgrades user role or owner adjusts permissions

#### "Tier upgrade required"
- **Cause**: Free/Pro user trying to access Team features
- **Fix**: Upgrade to Team tier ($69/month)

#### "API key invalid"
- **Cause**: Using individual API key for team operations
- **Fix**: Generate organization-level API key

### Getting Help
1. **Check logs**: Organization audit trail in dashboard
2. **Contact support**: [support@minoots.com](mailto:support@minoots.com)
3. **Review permissions**: User role vs required action
4. **API reference**: [Complete documentation](./API_REFERENCE.md)
