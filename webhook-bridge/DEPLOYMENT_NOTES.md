# ðŸš¨ WEBHOOK BRIDGE DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

## PROBLEM
The webhook-bridge is trying to deploy to the same Firebase project as the main MINOOTS API, but they have conflicting function names and different architectures.

## SOLUTION OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: Deploy to Separate Firebase Project (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Create new Firebase project for webhook bridge
firebase projects:create minoots-webhook-bridge
firebase use minoots-webhook-bridge
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### OPTION 2: Use Firebase Emulator for Local Testing (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Run webhook-bridge locally for daemon testing
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore
# Bridge will be available at http://localhost:5001
```

### OPTION 3: Integrate into Main Functions (COMPLEX)
Merge webhook-bridge functions into the main functions/index.js

## CURRENT STATUS
**BLOCKED**: Cannot deploy webhook-bridge to same project as main API without conflicts.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Use emulator for testing, then decide on production deployment strategy.
