**Function Invocations:**
- Free: 2,000,000 invocations/month
- Current usage: ~1 invocation per timer creation + 1 per minute for checks

**Firestore Operations:**
- Free: 50K reads, 20K writes, 20K deletes per day
- Current usage: ~3 writes per timer + 1 read per check
- **Estimate:** 100 timers/day = ~400 operations/day = **WELL WITHIN FREE TIER**

**Function Memory & CPU:**

- Current usage: Minimal memory, short execution times
- **Estimate:** <10% of free tier usage

### 🎯 PROJECTED COSTS AT SCALE
