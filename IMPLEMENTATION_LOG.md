6. ‚úÖ Verified all endpoints working
7. ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with final status

**Final Tests Performed:**
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint: Working
- ‚úÖ Pricing endpoint: Working
- ‚úÖ Authentication blocking: Working

### Entry #4: Wave 0 Platform Hardening - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 18:00-23:30 UTC
**Task:** Execute Wave 0 exit criteria for the async refactor charter (durable persistence, JetStream mesh, telemetry bootstrap)
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Wave 0 complete, Wave 1 pending)

**Actions:**
1. Introduced Postgres-backed timer repository in the control plane with automated SQL migrations and OTEL-aware request middleware.
2. Wired OpenTelemetry Node SDK (OTLP/HTTP) plus structured HTTP logging and graceful shutdown of the control plane service.
3. Added repository bootstrap assets: `.env.example`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, OTEL collector config, and `scripts/bootstrap-dev.sh` to orchestrate infra + migrations.
4. Refactored the action orchestrator to consume JetStream durable consumers with DLQ publishing, including an `ensure-jetstream` provisioning script.
5. Extended the Rust horology kernel with a persistence trait, Postgres adapter (SQLx), restoration path, and new tests covering restart hydration.
6. Authored developer guide `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` describing Wave 0 bootstrap and verification steps.
7. Wired the kernel binary to honor `KERNEL_STORE`/`KERNEL_DATABASE_URL` for Postgres without code changes.
8. Delivered JetStream dead-letter replay utility (`scripts/replay-dead-letter.js`) and npm scripts for inspect/replay flows.
9. Added repository automation: devlog enforcement script, infra smoke test script, and GitHub Actions CI workflow covering Node/Rust builds.

**Telemetry / Artifacts:**
- Postgres table `timer_records` via migration `0001_create_timer_records.sql`.
- OTEL collector logs available through `docker logs minoots-otel-collector` after running the bootstrap script.
- JetStream DLQ subject `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq` seeded by `ensure-jetstream.js`.
- DLQ replay output via `npm run dlq:inspect` targeting `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq`.
- CI workflow logs under GitHub Actions `CI` pipeline (devlog enforcement + smoke tests).

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up JetStream integration tests exercising DLQ replay and success-path fan-out.
- Document telemetry expectations for multi-store kernel deployments and add alerting TODOs.
- Begin Wave 1 workstreams (policy wall, Raft coordination, signed envelopes).

## üîß TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision:** Dual auth system (Firebase tokens + API keys)
- **Reason:** Firebase for web users, API keys for SDK/CLI users
- **Impact:** More flexible for developers

### Rate Limiting Approach
- **Decision:** Tier-based using express-rate-limit
- **Reason:** Simple to implement, battle-tested
- **Tiers:** Free (10/min), Pro (100/min), Team (500/min)

### Usage Tracking
- **Decision:** Daily Firestore documents per user
- **Reason:** Easy to query, automatic cleanup possible
- **Format:** `usage/{userId}_{date}`

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT

1. **Firebase Admin SDK** - Not initialized in middleware yet
2. **Environment Variables** - Need to add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
3. **Testing** - Auth endpoints need Postman collection
4. **Deployment** - Will need to redeploy after auth changes

Next update due: After auth implementation complete
### Entry #4: Async Refactor Program Kickoff - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 23:00-23:15 UTC
**Task:** Consolidate ultimate async refactor charter, establish devlog/testing system, and seed Day 0 devlog entry.
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Actions:**
1. Authored `docs/ASYNC_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` aligning architecture, development track, and execution program.
2. Documented dev logging + testing governance in `docs/DEVLOG_AND_TESTING_SYSTEM.md`.
3. Created `docs/devlog/2025-10-15.md` to start daily logging cadence with stream-specific updates and follow-ups.

**Tests Performed:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Formal test suites deferred pending upcoming persistence and telemetry changes.

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up docker-compose environment (DX-001) and capture first OTEL traces.
- File backlog tickets (`CP-PERSIST-01`, `HK-PERSIST-01`, `EM-JETSTREAM-01`, etc.) and link them in devlog updates.
- Draft ADR on persistence substrate selection before implementing storage adapters.
