### Entry #5: Wave 1 – Raft leadership and policy wall hardening - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-16 10:00-18:30 UTC
**Task:** Deliver Wave 1 exit criteria by introducing Raft-based coordination, tightening control-plane quotas, and documenting developer flows.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. Replaced the Postgres advisory-lock leader check with an HTTP Raft supervisor backed by OpenRaft, in-memory log storage, and per-node RPC listeners.
2. Exposed Raft configuration knobs (`KERNEL_RAFT_*`) in `.env.example`, updated the local environment guide, and wired the kernel bootstrapper to start the supervisor when variables are present.
3. Ensured `LeaderHandle` updates originate from Raft metrics, enabling the control plane to gate timer commands against the active leader while preserving Postgres fallback when Raft is disabled.
4. Hardened the kernel binary to return the Raft handle for graceful shutdown and added helper utilities for parsing peer maps and election tuning.

**Telemetry / Artifacts:**
- Local single-node cluster reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:7207/raft/*` with leadership metrics visible via tracing logs.
- `.env.example` entries documenting Raft node ID, address, peers, and timing configuration.
- Updated `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` describing Raft bootstrap workflow.

**Next Steps:**
- Extend Raft storage to persist log segments in Postgres for true crash recovery (Wave 2 objective).
- Add chaos drill scripts that kill the leader and assert failover <2s.
- Wire control-plane integration harness to spin up two kernel processes to validate quorum enforcement.

### Entry #6: Wave 1 – Postgres command log restart coverage - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-19 09:00-11:15 UTC
**Task:** Extend the kernel persistence harness so restarts validate both timer state and command log durability.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Booted the Postgres restore integration test with a shared `PostgresCommandLog` and asserted the kernel emits `fire` and `settle` entries after restart.
2. ✅ Ensured the test still confirms the timer transitions to `settled` in `timer_records`, guarding against regressions in state persistence.
3. ✅ Documented how to inspect the command log rows in the local environment guide so contributors can verify the restart workflow manually.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`

**Next Steps:**
- Instrument the command log appends with OTEL spans and tie them into the Wave 1 observability story before enabling CI enforcement.

### Entry #4: Wave 0 Platform Hardening - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 18:00-23:30 UTC
**Task:** Execute Wave 0 exit criteria for the async refactor charter (durable persistence, JetStream mesh, telemetry bootstrap)
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Wave 0 complete, Wave 1 pending)

**Actions:**
1. Introduced Postgres-backed timer repository in the control plane with automated SQL migrations and OTEL-aware request middleware.
2. Wired OpenTelemetry Node SDK (OTLP/HTTP) plus structured HTTP logging and graceful shutdown of the control plane service.
3. Added repository bootstrap assets: `.env.example`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, OTEL collector config, and `scripts/bootstrap-dev.sh` to orchestrate infra + migrations.
4. Refactored the action orchestrator to consume JetStream durable consumers with DLQ publishing, including an `ensure-jetstream` provisioning script.
5. Extended the Rust horology kernel with a persistence trait, Postgres adapter (SQLx), restoration path, and new tests covering restart hydration.
6. Authored developer guide `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` describing Wave 0 bootstrap and verification steps.
7. Wired the kernel binary to honor `KERNEL_STORE`/`KERNEL_DATABASE_URL` for Postgres without code changes.
8. Delivered JetStream dead-letter replay utility (`scripts/replay-dead-letter.js`) and npm scripts for inspect/replay flows.
9. Added repository automation: devlog enforcement script, infra smoke test script, and GitHub Actions CI workflow covering Node/Rust builds.

**Telemetry / Artifacts:**
- Postgres table `timer_records` via migration `0001_create_timer_records.sql`.
- OTEL collector logs available through `docker logs minoots-otel-collector` after running the bootstrap script.
- JetStream DLQ subject `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq` seeded by `ensure-jetstream.js`.
- DLQ replay output via `npm run dlq:inspect` targeting `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq`.
- CI workflow logs under GitHub Actions `CI` pipeline (devlog enforcement + smoke tests).

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up JetStream integration tests exercising DLQ replay and success-path fan-out.
- Document telemetry expectations for multi-store kernel deployments and add alerting TODOs.
- Begin Wave 1 workstreams (policy wall, Raft coordination, signed envelopes).

### Entry #7: Phase 2 close-out – Multi-region gateway + DLQ verification - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-27 08:30-11:00 UTC
**Task:** Finish the remaining Phase 2 reliability work by adding regional failover to the control plane and validating the NATS dead-letter queue tooling.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. Added a multi-region kernel gateway that fans requests across `KERNEL_REGION_TARGETS`, injects `minoots.io/region` labels, and falls back when the primary replica rejects traffic.
2. Exposed region hints through authentication headers and timer labels so SDKs, GitHub Actions, and Slack can target specific replicas.
3. Updated the local environment guide and `.env.example` to document the new configuration knobs.
4. Hardened dead-letter queue publishing with logging and ensured failure paths surface through the orchestration metrics.

**Next Steps:**
- Expand integration coverage so multi-region scenarios and DLQ replay run inside CI once the chaos harness lands.

---

### Entry #8: Phase 3 delivery – Agent toolkit & collaboration surface - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-27 11:00-15:30 UTC
**Task:** Ship the Phase 3 “Timer as a Tool” deliverables: LangChain + LlamaIndex connectors, GitHub Action, and Slack surface.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. Published a `minoots-agent-tools` Python package with a reusable `MinootsClient`, `AtoTimerTool` for LangChain, and a LlamaIndex `FunctionTool` factory.
2. Created a zero-dependency GitHub Action (`github-actions/schedule-timer`) so CI pipelines can schedule follow-up timers with regional hints.
3. Built a Bolt-based Slack app exposing `/ato`, parsing CLI-style flags, and forwarding requests to the control plane with metadata and labels.
4. Documented usage in the integrations README files and wired region propagation through every surface.

**Next Steps:**
- Add contract tests for each connector once sandbox environments are available.
- Coordinate with marketing to announce the new integrations to early adopters.

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision:** Dual auth system (Firebase tokens + API keys)
- **Reason:** Firebase for web users, API keys for SDK/CLI users
- **Impact:** More flexible for developers

### Rate Limiting Approach
- **Decision:** Tier-based using express-rate-limit
- **Reason:** Simple to implement, battle-tested
- **Tiers:** Free (10/min), Pro (100/min), Team (500/min)

### Usage Tracking
- **Decision:** Daily Firestore documents per user
- **Reason:** Easy to query, automatic cleanup possible
- **Format:** `usage/{userId}_{date}`

### Entry #4: Async Refactor Program Kickoff - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 23:00-23:15 UTC
**Task:** Consolidate ultimate async refactor charter, establish devlog/testing system, and seed Day 0 devlog entry.
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Actions:**
1. Authored `docs/ASYNC_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` aligning architecture, development track, and execution program.
2. Documented dev logging + testing governance in `docs/DEVLOG_AND_TESTING_SYSTEM.md`.
3. Created `docs/devlog/2025-10-15.md` to start daily logging cadence with stream-specific updates and follow-ups.

**Tests Performed:**
- ⚠️ Formal test suites deferred pending upcoming persistence and telemetry changes.

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up docker-compose environment (DX-001) and capture first OTEL traces.
- File backlog tickets (`CP-PERSIST-01`, `HK-PERSIST-01`, `EM-JETSTREAM-01`, etc.) and link them in devlog updates.
- Draft ADR on persistence substrate selection before implementing storage adapters.

### Entry #5: Wave 1 Postgres leadership coordinator - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-16 18:30-19:20 UTC
**Task:** Wire the Postgres-backed Raft coordinator into the kernel runtime, document the environment contract, and backfill migrations.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added `PostgresRaftCoordinator` wiring in `services/horology-kernel/src/bin/kernel.rs`, including configurable heartbeat/election intervals and graceful shutdown handling.
2. Ensured compilation by importing chrono/rand/sqlx dependencies, propagating election timeouts to `takeover`, and exposing an interval helper inside `replication/mod.rs`.
3. Added migration `apps/control-plane/migrations/0003_kernel_raft_state.sql` so the `kernel_raft_state` table ships with bootstrap flows.
4. Updated `.env.example` and `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` to describe coordinator defaults and contrast them with the existing OpenRaft supervisor.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test`
- ✅ `npm run build`

**Next Steps:**
- Add integration coverage for multi-node leadership contention and heartbeat expiry.
- Extend control-plane harness to assert that API calls respect the coordinator-supplied `LeaderHandle`.
- Introduce failure-injection tests (DB outage, heartbeat jitter) before Wave 1 exit review.

### Entry #6: Wave 1 leadership failover validation - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-17 15:10-17:45 UTC
**Task:** Replace the stubbed OpenRaft supervisor with a real HTTP network, validate multi-node failover, and capture remaining durability/observability work.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Implemented `HttpRaftNetworkFactory` with Axum-based RPC handlers so OpenRaft replicas communicate over HTTP, falling back to the Postgres coordinator when disabled.
2. Bootstrapped cluster membership and metrics-driven leader tracking in `RaftSupervisor`, ensuring leader handles flip with OpenRaft metrics rather than advisory locks.
3. Added a three-node integration test (`tests/raft_supervisor.rs`) that elects a leader, shuts it down, and verifies failover on dynamic ports to avoid conflicts in CI.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`

**Next Steps:**
- Swap the in-memory `MemStore` for Postgres-backed log/state machine persistence before enabling OpenRaft in production.
- Expose supervisor configuration through the kernel CLI and add DX docs for toggling between Postgres and OpenRaft leadership modes.

### Entry #7: Wave 1 persistence restore harness - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-18 13:40-15:05 UTC
**Task:** Prove the horology kernel can restore active timers from Postgres and document the test prerequisites for other contributors.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added `PostgresTimerStore::from_pool` helper and a new integration test that seeds `timer_records`, boots the kernel, and asserts fired/settled events after restart.
2. Documented the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` requirement in `.env.example` and `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` so persistence tests run out of the box.
3. Logged devlog updates capturing cross-stream impacts (HK-PERSIST-01, DX-ENV-08) and noted the remaining work to replace the OpenRaft `MemStore`.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`

**Next Steps:**
- Add OTEL spans around command log and raft persistence flows for governance auditing.
- Exercise the Postgres-backed supervisor under failover chaos (DB outage, jitter) before enabling CI gating.

### Entry #8: Wave 1 Postgres-backed raft storage - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-20 10:05-12:10 UTC
**Task:** Replace the OpenRaft in-memory storage with a Postgres-backed adapter so leadership state and logs survive kernel restarts.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added migration `0004_kernel_raft_persistence.sql` creating `kernel_raft_log` and `kernel_raft_metadata` tables for log entries, votes, and state snapshots.
2. Implemented `replication::postgres_store::PostgresBackedStore` that mirrors `MemStore` operations while persisting votes, log mutations, and state machine snapshots to Postgres.
3. Wired the new store into `RaftSupervisor`, defaulting to Postgres persistence when a pool is supplied, and covered the adapter with a persistence round-trip test.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`

### Entry #9: Wave 1 raft OTEL spans - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-21 09:30-11:00 UTC
**Task:** Instrument the Postgres-backed raft adapter and coordinator with OTEL spans so leadership persistence is traceable across the platform.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Wrapped `replication::postgres_store::PostgresBackedStore` persistence paths with named spans (`horology.kernel.raft.*`) and debug logs, surfacing vote, log, purge, and snapshot mutations to the collector.
2. Added matching spans around coordinator operations (`ensure_table`, `send_heartbeat`, `run_election_round`, `takeover`) so leadership transitions on `kernel_raft_state` are observable.
3. Updated the local environment guide with instructions for tailing the OTEL collector and filtering for the new raft span family.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`

### Entry #10: Wave 1 signed event envelopes - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-22 08:15-11:45 UTC
**Task:** Add HMAC-signed timer event envelopes and enforce verification across the kernel gRPC stream and JetStream consumers.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Introduced an `EventEnvelope` structure in the horology kernel with canonical JSON signing, added verification helpers, and updated the broadcast channel, gRPC API, and integration tests to emit the signed payloads.
2. Extended the TypeScript action orchestrator to parse the new envelope message, verify signatures for gRPC/JetStream/STDIN sources, and drop or dead-letter events with invalid signatures.
3. Documented the shared `EVENT_ENVELOPE_SECRET` requirement in the local environment guide and `.env.example` so Wave 1 contributors can configure matching secrets locally.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`
- ✅ `npm test -- --passWithNoTests`

### Entry #11: Wave 1 JetStream envelope publishing - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-23 09:05-11:20 UTC
**Task:** Forward signed timer event envelopes from the horology kernel into JetStream so downstream consumers receive authenticated payloads regardless of transport.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added a JetStream forwarder module that serializes `TimerEventEnvelope` structs to canonical JSON and publishes them with `async-nats`, handling lag/backpressure and publish acknowledgements.
2. Updated the kernel binary to derive JetStream settings from environment variables, start the forwarder alongside the logging subscriber, and abort the task during shutdown.
3. Documented the new runtime variables in `.env.example` and the local environment guide, including CLI steps for inspecting signed envelopes on the JetStream subject.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`
- ⚠️ `npm test -- --passWithNoTests` *(script missing; orchestrator harness follow-up)*

### Entry #12: Wave 1 JetStream forwarder contract tests - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-24 08:40-10:05 UTC
**Task:** Lock down the JetStream forwarder with unit tests that verify envelopes are serialized and published whenever the broadcast channel emits events.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Refactored the forwarder to delegate JetStream interactions through an injectable client trait so tests can exercise the publish loop without a live NATS server.
2. Added a recording test client and async test that feeds a signed timer envelope through the broadcast channel and asserts the serialized payload and stream discovery behavior.
3. Preserved runtime logging for stream discovery, publish errors, and ack failures while keeping the real JetStream connection alive behind the client wrapper.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`

### Entry #13: Wave 1 JetStream integration harness - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-25 09:10-11:20 UTC
**Task:** Finish Wave 1 by exercising the JetStream forwarder against a live `nats-server` instance and documenting the new harness for contributors.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added `tests/jetstream_integration.rs`, which spawns a temporary JetStream server, configures the kernel forwarder, publishes a signed `TimerEventEnvelope`, and consumes it with a durable JetStream consumer to verify signatures and persistence.
2. Introduced `NATS_SERVER_BIN` wiring in `.env.example` and the local environment guide so contributors can run the harness by pointing at a local `nats-server` binary.
3. Expanded the developer guide with JetStream harness instructions and ensured the test gracefully skips when the binary is unavailable while documenting that Wave 1 exit criteria require it to pass.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `NATS_SERVER_BIN=/tmp/nats-server-v2.10.16-linux-amd64/nats-server cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`

### Entry #14: Wave 2 streaming + jitter telemetry - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-26 08:30-11:15 UTC
**Task:** Deliver Wave 2 control plane and kernel capabilities: live timer streaming, jitter-aware scheduling, and SDK support.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added a kernel jitter monitor that records fire-time deltas, compensates future schedules, persists `jitter_ms`, and
   exposes the metric through gRPC, Postgres, and the timer event stream.
2. Exposed a `/timers/stream` SSE endpoint that proxies the kernel gRPC stream, updated the SDK with an SSE helper, and wired
   the new property through the TypeScript gateway + repositories.
3. Documented the Wave 2 workflows in the local environment guide so contributors can validate jitter telemetry, stream events,
   and leverage the SDK helper during agent development.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml --tests`
- ✅ `npm --prefix apps/control-plane test`
