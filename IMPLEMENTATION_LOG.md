### Entry #5: Wave 1 – Raft leadership and policy wall hardening - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-16 10:00-18:30 UTC
**Task:** Deliver Wave 1 exit criteria by introducing Raft-based coordination, tightening control-plane quotas, and documenting developer flows.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. Replaced the Postgres advisory-lock leader check with an HTTP Raft supervisor backed by OpenRaft, in-memory log storage, and per-node RPC listeners.
2. Exposed Raft configuration knobs (`KERNEL_RAFT_*`) in `.env.example`, updated the local environment guide, and wired the kernel bootstrapper to start the supervisor when variables are present.
3. Ensured `LeaderHandle` updates originate from Raft metrics, enabling the control plane to gate timer commands against the active leader while preserving Postgres fallback when Raft is disabled.
4. Hardened the kernel binary to return the Raft handle for graceful shutdown and added helper utilities for parsing peer maps and election tuning.

**Telemetry / Artifacts:**
- Local single-node cluster reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:7207/raft/*` with leadership metrics visible via tracing logs.
- `.env.example` entries documenting Raft node ID, address, peers, and timing configuration.
- Updated `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` describing Raft bootstrap workflow.

**Next Steps:**
- Extend Raft storage to persist log segments in Postgres for true crash recovery (Wave 2 objective).
- Add chaos drill scripts that kill the leader and assert failover <2s.
- Wire control-plane integration harness to spin up two kernel processes to validate quorum enforcement.

### Entry #6: Wave 1 – Postgres coordinator election fix & harness validation - COMPLETE
**Time:** 2025-10-18 09:30-12:30 UTC
**Task:** Repair the Postgres-based coordinator so kernel binaries elect a leader and unblock the Phase 1 multi-kernel harness.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Actions:**
1. Reworked the heartbeat and election worker loops to use `tokio::select!` with pinned sleepers, ensuring the stop channel no longer stalls periodic ticks.
2. Added jitter-aware delay handling so election rounds trigger immediately when the leader record is missing and back off according to the configured timeout window.
3. Verified `kernel_raft_state` initialization by running the kernel binary inside the harness, confirming the coordinator inserts and updates the leader row under real Postgres.
4. Ran the Phase 1 harness end to end, demonstrating failover from `kernel-a` to `kernel-b` while scraping the Prometheus metrics for coordinator counters.
5. Updated the Wave 1 devlog to capture the fix, ensuring future agents understand the root cause and validation steps.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `TS_NODE_PROJECT=apps/control-plane/tsconfig.json node -r ts-node/register/transpile-only -r ./scripts/ts-node-preload.js tests/phase1/runHarness.ts`

**Next Steps:**
- Land Grafana/Honeycomb dashboards that alert on repeated `ElectionResult::Error` or missing heartbeats (HK-OBS-04).
- Integrate the harness into CI once the containerized Postgres service is available (DX-TEST-07).

### Entry #4: Wave 0 Platform Hardening - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 18:00-23:30 UTC
**Task:** Execute Wave 0 exit criteria for the async refactor charter (durable persistence, JetStream mesh, telemetry bootstrap)
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Wave 0 complete, Wave 1 pending)

**Actions:**
1. Introduced Postgres-backed timer repository in the control plane with automated SQL migrations and OTEL-aware request middleware.
2. Wired OpenTelemetry Node SDK (OTLP/HTTP) plus structured HTTP logging and graceful shutdown of the control plane service.
3. Added repository bootstrap assets: `.env.example`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, OTEL collector config, and `scripts/bootstrap-dev.sh` to orchestrate infra + migrations.
4. Refactored the action orchestrator to consume JetStream durable consumers with DLQ publishing, including an `ensure-jetstream` provisioning script.
5. Extended the Rust horology kernel with a persistence trait, Postgres adapter (SQLx), restoration path, and new tests covering restart hydration.
6. Authored developer guide `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` describing Wave 0 bootstrap and verification steps.
7. Wired the kernel binary to honor `KERNEL_STORE`/`KERNEL_DATABASE_URL` for Postgres without code changes.
8. Delivered JetStream dead-letter replay utility (`scripts/replay-dead-letter.js`) and npm scripts for inspect/replay flows.
9. Added repository automation: devlog enforcement script, infra smoke test script, and GitHub Actions CI workflow covering Node/Rust builds.

**Telemetry / Artifacts:**
- Postgres table `timer_records` via migration `0001_create_timer_records.sql`.
- OTEL collector logs available through `docker logs minoots-otel-collector` after running the bootstrap script.
- JetStream DLQ subject `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq` seeded by `ensure-jetstream.js`.
- DLQ replay output via `npm run dlq:inspect` targeting `MINOOTS_TIMER.dlq`.
- CI workflow logs under GitHub Actions `CI` pipeline (devlog enforcement + smoke tests).

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up JetStream integration tests exercising DLQ replay and success-path fan-out.
- Document telemetry expectations for multi-store kernel deployments and add alerting TODOs.
- Begin Wave 1 workstreams (policy wall, Raft coordination, signed envelopes).

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision:** Dual auth system (Firebase tokens + API keys)
- **Reason:** Firebase for web users, API keys for SDK/CLI users
- **Impact:** More flexible for developers

### Rate Limiting Approach
- **Decision:** Tier-based using express-rate-limit
- **Reason:** Simple to implement, battle-tested
- **Tiers:** Free (10/min), Pro (100/min), Team (500/min)

### Entry #4: Async Refactor Program Kickoff - IN PROGRESS
**Time:** 2025-10-15 23:00-23:15 UTC
**Task:** Consolidate ultimate async refactor charter, establish devlog/testing system, and seed Day 0 devlog entry.
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Actions:**
1. Authored `docs/ASYNC_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` aligning architecture, development track, and execution program.
2. Documented dev logging + testing governance in `docs/DEVLOG_AND_TESTING_SYSTEM.md`.
3. Created `docs/devlog/2025-10-15.md` to start daily logging cadence with stream-specific updates and follow-ups.

**Tests Performed:**
- ⚠️ Formal test suites deferred pending upcoming persistence and telemetry changes.

**Next Steps:**
- Stand up docker-compose environment (DX-001) and capture first OTEL traces.
- File backlog tickets (`CP-PERSIST-01`, `HK-PERSIST-01`, `EM-JETSTREAM-01`, etc.) and link them in devlog updates.
- Draft ADR on persistence substrate selection before implementing storage adapters.

### Entry #5: Wave 1 Postgres leadership coordinator - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-16 18:30-19:20 UTC
**Task:** Wire the Postgres-backed Raft coordinator into the kernel runtime, document the environment contract, and backfill migrations.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added `PostgresRaftCoordinator` wiring in `services/horology-kernel/src/bin/kernel.rs`, including configurable heartbeat/election intervals and graceful shutdown handling.
2. Ensured compilation by importing chrono/rand/sqlx dependencies, propagating election timeouts to `takeover`, and exposing an interval helper inside `replication/mod.rs`.
3. Added migration `apps/control-plane/migrations/0003_kernel_raft_state.sql` so the `kernel_raft_state` table ships with bootstrap flows.
4. Updated `.env.example` and `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` to describe coordinator defaults and contrast them with the existing OpenRaft supervisor.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test`
- ✅ `npm run build`

**Next Steps:**
- Add integration coverage for multi-node leadership contention and heartbeat expiry.
- Extend control-plane harness to assert that API calls respect the coordinator-supplied `LeaderHandle`.
- Introduce failure-injection tests (DB outage, heartbeat jitter) before Wave 1 exit review.

### Entry #6: Wave 1 leadership failover validation - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-17 15:10-16:05 UTC
**Task:** Validate the Postgres-backed coordinator through integration tests, surface follower errors to the control plane, and document failover semantics for DX.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added deterministic tests in `services/horology-kernel/src/replication/mod.rs` that exercise leader election and follower failover against Postgres, ensuring handles flip during shutdown and stale heartbeats.
2. Enhanced the control plane gateway to translate kernel `FAILED_PRECONDITION` responses into structured `503` errors with optional retry hints, and wired HTTP handling to advertise Retry-After headers.
3. Updated `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md` with guidance on observing the new failover behaviour in local multi-node setups.
4. Instrumented the Postgres coordinator with OTEL spans and Prometheus counters for election attempts, outcomes, heartbeat publications, and leadership transitions while exposing a `/metrics` endpoint from the kernel binary.
5. Extended the Phase 1 integration harness to assert follower `503` behaviour (including `retry-after`) via a simulated follower gateway so control plane regressions surface immediately.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test`
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ `node tests/phase1/runHarness.ts`

**Next Steps:**
- Add a multi-kernel harness that spins up two real kernel binaries (Postgres-backed) to exercise failover end-to-end instead of relying on the simulated follower gateway.
- Publish Grafana dashboards (or OTEL Collector processors) that visualise the new coordinator metrics and wire alerts for leadership churn and repeated election errors.

### Entry #7: Kernel telemetry + gRPC harness hardening - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-17 18:20-20:05 UTC
**Task:** Finish wiring kernel telemetry endpoints, solidify gRPC gateway behaviour, and unblock the Phase 1 integration harness.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added `telemetry` module to the kernel (`services/horology-kernel/src/telemetry/*`) with OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus registry wiring, and a graceful shutdown path; default metrics listener is now configurable via `KERNEL_METRICS_ADDR`.
2. Exported replication counters for election attempts, heartbeat outcomes, and leadership transitions while instrumenting the Postgres coordinator loop with OTEL spans.
3. Updated control-plane gRPC gateway to resolve the shared proto from the repo root, normalise `durationMs` payloads, and map `KernelNotLeaderError` to `FAILED_PRECONDITION` with retry metadata; improved error logging for unexpected failures.
4. Hardened the Phase 1 harness with environment fallback (`.env`/`.env.example`), Postgres truncation between phases, and a real gRPC client built from the proto loader; added the preload shim for CommonJS module defaults.
5. Documented the harness workflow in `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md`, refreshed `.env.example` with telemetry defaults, and logged the work in the Wave 1 devlog.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test -- --passWithNoTests`
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ `node scripts/check-devlog-entry.js`
- ✅ `node -r ts-node/register/transpile-only -r ./scripts/ts-node-preload.js tests/phase1/runHarness.ts`

**Next Steps:**
- Extend harness coverage to consume kernel metrics and assert Prometheus endpoints are reachable during test runs.
- Integrate the harness invocation into CI (GitHub Actions) once a lightweight Postgres container is available in runners.
- Add otel collector configuration samples for shipping kernel traces to Honeycomb/Grafana Cloud in developer environments.
- Publish Grafana dashboards (or OTEL Collector processors) that visualise the new coordinator metrics and wire alerts for leadership churn and repeated election errors.

### Entry #8: Wave 1 multi-kernel failover harness - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-18 16:45-18:10 UTC
**Task:** Extend the Phase 1 harness to launch real Postgres-backed kernels, validate failover/metrics end to end, and document the new workflow.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Added kernel process orchestration to `tests/phase1/runHarness.ts`, spawning two `cargo run --bin kernel` instances with dedicated gRPC/metrics ports, probing readiness, and enforcing graceful shutdown.
2. Implemented Postgres-backed cluster validation that identifies the current leader, kills it, waits for follower promotion, and verifies Prometheus metrics continue to surface `kernel_coordinator` counters post-failover.
3. Updated the harness to clean Postgres tables between phases, fetch metrics output, and log combined HTTP/gRPC/follower/cluster outcomes for traceability.
4. Documented the new workflow in `docs/devx/LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT.md`, highlighting kernel build prerequisites and the expanded coverage.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `node -r ts-node/register/transpile-only -r ./scripts/ts-node-preload.js tests/phase1/runHarness.ts`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test -- --passWithNoTests`
- ✅ `npm run build`

**Next Steps:**
- Cache the kernel binary during CI harness runs to avoid repeated compilation overhead.
- Integrate the harness into the GitHub Actions workflow once containerised Postgres is wired.
- Backfill Grafana dashboard definitions covering coordinator leadership churn, failover latency, and harness health signals.

### Entry #9: OpenRaft supervisor + integration tests - COMPLETED
**Time:** 2025-10-19 14:10-16:00 UTC
**Task:** Replace the Raft stub with a functional HTTP-driven OpenRaft supervisor, add failover coverage, and document the new operational flow.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions:**
1. Implemented an HTTP-backed OpenRaft network (`/raft-append`, `/raft-vote`, `/raft-snapshot`) with automatic peer discovery from `KERNEL_RAFT_PEERS`, normalised address handling, and error propagation into the existing telemetry metrics.
2. Added the `RaftSupervisor` runtime that boots the memstore-backed OpenRaft node, exposes leadership changes through the shared `LeaderHandle`, and runs an Axum server with graceful shutdown support.
3. Expanded the replication test suite with single-node coverage and a three-node failover scenario (quorum-aware) to ensure leadership election and takeover semantics behave as expected.
4. Updated the local environment guide to document multi-node Raft bring-up alongside the existing Postgres coordinator instructions.

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `cargo test --manifest-path services/horology-kernel/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `npm test -- --passWithNoTests`
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ `node scripts/check-devlog-entry.js`

**Next Steps:**
- Feed Raft leadership metrics into the Phase 1 harness so the end-to-end smoke validates both coordinator implementations.
- Extend the control plane to surface Raft health alongside the Postgres coordinator counters for parity.
- Layer in snapshot/persistence adapters once the replicated command log work begins in Wave 2.
