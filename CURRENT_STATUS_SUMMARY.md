- **Usage Tracking** - Daily timer limits and concurrent timer limits enforced
- **Security Middleware** - All endpoints properly secured except public ones

### üí∞ Payment & Billing System
- **Stripe Integration** - Complete checkout flow implementation
- **Subscription Management** - Handle Pro/Team tier upgrades
- **Webhook Processing** - Automatic tier upgrades when payments succeed
- **Billing Portal** - Customers can manage subscriptions
- **Pricing API** - Public endpoint showing all tiers and features

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Core Timer System
- **REST API** - 7 working endpoints with authentication
- **Real-time Progress** - Timer progress calculated in real-time
- **Scheduled Functions** - Automatic timer expiration processing
- **Tier Limits** - Free tier: 5 concurrent, 100/day; Pro/Team: unlimited
- **Webhook Support** - Timers can trigger webhooks on expiration

### ü§ñ Agent Integration
- **MCP Server** - 8 tools for Claude agent integration (Pro tier only)
- **Node.js SDK** - Complete SDK with examples and tests
- **API Documentation** - Comprehensive docs and Postman collection

### üß∞ Phase 3 Tooling Boost (2025-11-03)
- Node SDK now ships resilient retry/backoff helpers with lifecycle hooks for instrumentation.
- React (`sdk/react/useMinootsTimer.ts`) and Vue (`sdk/vue/useMinootsTimer.ts`) bindings unblock dashboard workstreams.
- Python SDK adds LangChain `AtoTimerTool` and LlamaIndex helpers with optional dependencies for agent stacks.
- Respx-backed pytest harness validates the async Python client offline, covering happy paths, API errors, and timeout handling.
- GitHub Action (`.github/actions/minoots-timer`) and Slack `/ato` command reference integration accelerate ops automation.

### üõ°Ô∏è Phase 4 Foundations Ignited
- Firestore rules, Express middleware, and new `/teams` endpoints deliver working organization + RBAC scaffolding.
- Timer APIs enforce team membership‚Äîanonymous access now restricted to personal timers only.
- Team management utilities (`functions/utils/teamService.js`) centralize invites, role changes, and membership lists.
- Invitation lifecycle endpoints + Stripe team billing linkage let owners issue tokens, accept invites, and attach subscription metadata to teams.

### üß± Phase 4 Enterprise Feature Suite (2025-11-04)
- Collaboration mode ships with `/teams/:teamId/shared-timers` APIs, collaborator role controls, and Firestore guardrails so editors can co-manage timers safely.
- `/teams/:teamId/analytics/*` endpoints surface usage summaries, timer history, and active snapshots for the upcoming admin dashboard.
- Full billing console: owners can record metered usage, list invoices, rotate payment methods, trigger trials, and apply promotions directly via the API.
- SSO providers (OIDC + SAML) can be configured per team with public assertion endpoint issuing Firebase custom tokens and auto-provisioning memberships.
- Timer templates, cron schedules, dependency unlocking, conditional execution, retry backoff, and worker assignments unlock the entire Phase 4 advanced timer backlog.
- `runScheduledTimers` Cloud Function materializes cron definitions, while metrics logging tracks drift/webhook latency for performance reviews.
