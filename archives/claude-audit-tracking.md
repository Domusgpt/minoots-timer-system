## 🚨 KEY FRAUDULENT PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### COMPLETE FABRICATIONS (Need total rewrite)
1. **BACKUP_RECOVERY.md** - PostgreSQL, AWS infrastructure (project uses Firebase)
2. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (project is Firebase-only)
3. **ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md** - All enterprise features fictional
4. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - All migration tools fictional
5. **MONITORING.md** - Prometheus, Grafana stack (project uses Firebase)
6. **SECURITY.md** - All compliance certifications fictional
7. **SSO_SETUP.md** - Complete SSO system fictional

### MAJOR FEATURE LIES (Need significant correction)
1. **on_progress webhooks** - FICTIONAL across multiple docs
2. **@minoots/timer-sdk** - Wrong package name (should be minoots-sdk)
3. **Advanced webhook features** - Retry logic, custom headers FICTIONAL
4. **Dashboard/UI** - User dashboard references but no UI exists
5. **Fake API endpoints** - /users/me, PUT endpoints, bulk operations
6. **Complex duration formats** - Only single units supported

### CONFIGURATION VS CODE ISSUES
1. **Stripe integration** - Code exists but not configured
2. **Rate limits** - Wrong values documented
3. **API responses** - Wrong response structures documented

## 📝 FIXING PROGRESS TRACKER

### Phase 1: DELETE Complete Fraud Documents (Systems that don't exist) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **DELETED** BACKUP_RECOVERY.md - Described PostgreSQL systems we don't have
- [x] **DELETED** DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Described Docker/K8s we don't use  
- [x] **DELETED** ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md - Described enterprise features we don't have
- [x] **DELETED** MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Described migration tools that don't exist
