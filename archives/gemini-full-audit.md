### **Audit of: `docs/API_QUICKSTART.md`**

This document provides a tutorial for new users to get started with the API.

| Line(s) | Claim | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 23-35 | cURL, JS, and Python examples for creating a timer via `POST /timers`. | `functions/index.js:218` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The code confirms the endpoint exists and the examples are correct. |
| 38-56 | Response format for creating a timer. | `functions/index.js:250` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The documented response includes `progress`, `timeRemaining`, and `expiresAt`. The code does **not** return these fields on creation. It only returns the core timer object. |
| 62-65 | `GET /timers/:id` endpoint to fetch a timer's status. | `functions/index.js:310` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The endpoint exists and functions as described. |
| 68-78 | Response for `GET /timers/:id` includes `progress` and `percentComplete`. | `functions/index.js:111` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code calculates and returns `progress` and `timeRemaining`, but there is no field named `percentComplete`. |
| 81-84 | `GET /timers` endpoint to list all timers. | `functions/index.js:278` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The endpoint exists and functions as described. |
| 90-103 | Webhook payload for `timer_expired` event includes a `metadata` block. | `functions/index.js:160` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The code sends a webhook payload but **does not** include the documented `metadata` object with `apiVersion` and `source`. |
| 129-146 | Example of a data processing monitor using `on_progress` webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `on_progress` event type **does not exist** in the code. The documentation is describing a fictional feature. |
| 152-171 | Flexible duration formats (`5m`, `2h`, `7d`) are supported. | `functions/index.js:79` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `RealTimer.parseDuration` function correctly handles these string formats. |
| 177-182 | Free Tier limits are 5 concurrent timers and 100/month. | `functions/index.js:221`, `234` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code checks for daily and concurrent limits, but the concept of a "monthly" limit is not implemented. The check is against a *daily* limit. |
| 184-189 | Pro Tier offers "Advanced webhooks (retry logic, custom headers)". | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | This is a complete fabrication. The webhook implementation is basic, with no retry logic or custom headers. |
| 192-208 | `GET /account/usage` endpoint exists and returns a specific JSON structure. | `functions/index.js:401` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The endpoint exists, but the response structure in the code does not match the documentation. The code returns `usage`, `apiKeys`, and `tier`, not the detailed `timersThisMonth`, `concurrentTimers`, etc. shown in the docs. |

### **Audit of: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`**

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all API endpoints.

| Section | Claim | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GET /health** | Response includes a `user` object with `id`, `tier`, and `permissions`. | `functions/index.js:700` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The code returns a simple status object. It does **not** include any user information. |
| **POST /timers** | Request body accepts `on_progress` events and a `metadata` object. | `functions/index.js:218` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The code does **not** handle `on_progress` events. The `metadata` object is accepted but not used for filtering or any other logic. |
| **POST /timers** | Response includes `progress`, `timeRemaining`, and `percentComplete`. | `functions/index.js:250` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The response on creation is the basic timer object. These fields are only calculated on `GET` requests. `percentComplete` never exists. |
| **GET /timers** | Supports query parameters `limit`, `offset`, and `tags`. | `functions/index.js:278` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code supports `status`, `agent_id`, `team`, `organizationId`, and `projectId`. It does **not** support `limit`, `offset`, or `tags` for filtering. |
| **GET /timers** | Response includes a `pagination` object. | `functions/index.js:278` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The response is a simple array of timers. There is no pagination logic or `pagination` object. |
| **GET /timers/{id}** | Response includes `percentComplete` and a `deliveryStatus` object. | `functions/index.js:111` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The code does **not** return `percentComplete` or a `deliveryStatus` object. This is a fabrication. |
| **PUT /timers/{id}** | An endpoint exists to update a timer. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is **no** `PUT /timers/:id` endpoint implemented in `index.js`. |
| **DELETE /timers/{id}** | Request body accepts a `reason` for cancellation. | `functions/index.js:321` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `DELETE` endpoint takes no request body. The concept of a cancellation `reason` does not exist. |
| **POST /quick/wait** | Request body accepts a `message`. | `functions/index.js:332` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The endpoint only accepts `duration`, `name`, `agent_id`, and `callback`. There is no `message` field. |
| **POST /teams/{teamId}/broadcast** | Response includes `id`, `sentAt`, and `recipients`. | `functions/index.js:356` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The response is a simple echo of the request data. It does not contain these calculated fields. |
| **GET /account/usage** | Response contains detailed usage, limits, and billing information. | `functions/index.js:401` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The actual response is much simpler, containing only high-level usage stats, API key stats, and the user's tier. The detailed breakdown is fictional. |
| **POST /account/api-keys** | Request body accepts `permissions` and `expiresAt`. | `functions/utils/apiKey.js:27` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `createApiKey` function does not support setting permissions or an expiration date on keys. |
| **GET /account/api-keys** | Response includes `keyPreview`, `permissions`, and `status`. | `functions/utils/apiKey.js:53` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code returns `keyPreview` but does **not** return `permissions` or `status` for each key. |
| **Webhook Events** | `timer_progress` and `timer_cancelled` events exist. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | These events are completely fabricated. Only `timer_expired` exists. |
| **Error Responses** | API returns structured error objects with codes and details. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The API returns simple `{ success: false, error: 'message' }` objects. The detailed error structure with codes does not exist. |
| **Rate Limits** | Documents specific rate limits per tier and response headers. | `functions/middleware/rateLimiter.js` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The implemented limits are different from the documented ones (e.g., Free is 10/min, not 60/min). The custom `X-Tier-Limit-Timers` headers are not implemented. |
| **Testing** | A test environment exists at `https://test-api.minoots.com`. | N/A | **Unverifiable** | ❓ Unknown | There is no evidence of a separate test environment. This is likely fictional. |
| **SDK Libraries** | Official SDKs for Python and Go exist. | `package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `package.json` only lists a `@minoots/sdk` for Node.js. There is no evidence of Python or Go SDKs. |

### **Audit of: `docs/AGENT_PATTERNS.md`**

This document provides example patterns for AI agents using the timer system.

| Pattern | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rate Limit Recovery** | The pattern is valid and uses a basic `on_expire` webhook. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | This pattern is achievable with the current codebase. |
| **Long-Running Process Monitoring** | The pattern relies on `on_progress` webhooks with percentage-based intervals. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `on_progress` event type is fictional. This entire pattern is impossible to implement as described. |
| **Multi-Agent Coordination** | The pattern is valid and uses basic `on_expire` webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | This pattern is achievable with the current codebase. |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | The pattern uses `on_expire` webhooks to chain agent actions. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | This pattern is achievable with the current codebase. |
| **Memory & State Management** | The pattern uses a recurring timer to trigger a memory refresh. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The pattern is valid, but the concept of a truly "recurring" timer is not natively supported. The example correctly shows that the agent itself would have to create the *next* timer upon expiration. The documentation doesn't make this limitation clear. |
| **Error Recovery** | The pattern is valid and uses a basic `on_expire` webhook. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | This pattern is achievable with the current codebase. |
| **Scheduled Agent Tasks** | The pattern describes scheduling daily routines. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | Same as the "Memory & State Management" pattern. This is not a true cron-style scheduler. The agent is responsible for re-scheduling the next 24-hour timer. The documentation could be clearer about this. |
| **Game Theory Patterns** | The pattern is valid and uses basic `on_expire` webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | This pattern is achievable with the current codebase. |

### **Audit of: `docs/BACKUP_RECOVERY.md`**

This document describes backup and recovery procedures.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The entire document describes a self-hosted, PostgreSQL-based application with manual backup scripts and complex cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes). | `firebase.json`, `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The project is serverless, using Firebase and Firestore. None of the described architecture, databases (PostgreSQL), or backup scripts are used. The document is completely irrelevant to the actual project. |

---

### **Audit of: `docs/CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md`**

This document describes the setup and use of a MINOOTS MCP server for Claude Desktop.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Guide** | An MCP server can be installed via `npm install -g @minoots/mcp-server`. | `package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `package.json` does not define a package named `@minoots/mcp-server`. The only relevant package is `@minoots/timer-system`, which is the main project, not a separate MCP server package. |
| **Setup Guide** | The MCP server can be run from source at `mcp/index.js`. | `mcp/index.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The file `mcp/index.js` exists, which is the entry point for the MCP server. |
| **Setup Guide** | The MCP server is configured via a `claude_desktop_config.json` file. | `mcp/claude-desktop-config.json` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | A sample configuration file exists, confirming this setup method. |
| **Available Tools** | Lists 8 available tools for Claude (`create_timer`, `list_timers`, etc.). | `mcp/index.js:100` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code implements 8 tools, but they are not exactly the same as the ones in the documentation. For example, the code has `delete_timer` and `broadcast_to_team`, while the docs list `cancel_timer` and `team_broadcast`. It also implements an `agent_coordination_session` tool not mentioned in the docs. |
| **`cancel_timer` Tool** | The `cancel_timer` tool accepts a `reason` parameter. | `functions/index.js:321` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | As established in previous audits, the `DELETE /timers/:id` endpoint does not accept a `reason`. Therefore, the MCP tool cannot support this feature. The implemented tool is `delete_timer`, which also does not take a reason. |
| **`team_broadcast` Tool** | A tool exists to broadcast messages to a team. | `mcp/index.js:200` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `broadcast_to_team` tool is implemented and correctly calls the corresponding API endpoint. |
| **Use Cases** | A use case describes setting up daily standup reminders. | `functions/index.js` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | As noted before, the system does not support true recurring timers. The agent would have to re-create the timer each day. The documentation implies a "set it and forget it" capability that doesn't exist. |
| **Use Cases** | A use case describes monitoring a long-running process with progress checks every 2 hours. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | This relies on the non-existent `on_progress` webhook feature. This use case is impossible to implement. |
| **Advanced Config** | The MCP server can be configured with default webhook URLs for Slack and Discord. | `mcp/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `mcp/index.js` code does **not** read or use any environment variables for default webhook URLs. |
| **Troubleshooting** | Mentions checking MINOOTS delivery logs in a dashboard. | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no evidence of a user-facing dashboard with webhook delivery logs. This is a fictional feature. |
| **Pricing Note** | States that MCP integration requires the Pro tier because it uses "advanced webhook features". | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The MCP integration may require the Pro tier, but the justification is false. The system does not have "advanced webhook features." |

### **Audit of: `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**

This document describes deployment procedures for various platforms.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All (except Firebase)** | Provides deployment guides for AWS, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. | `firebase.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The project is built solely for Firebase. All other deployment guides are completely irrelevant and fictional. |
| **Firebase: Env Config** | Environment variables are set using `firebase functions:config:set`. | `functions/index.js` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The code uses `process.env` to access variables, which is correct. However, the documented variables (`app.environment`, `sendgrid.api_key`) do not all appear to be used in the code. |
| **Firebase: Database Setup** | A script exists at `scripts/init-database.js` to initialize data. | `glob` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no `scripts/` directory or `init-database.js` file in the project. This is a fabrication. |
| **Cloud Run Deployment** | A Dockerfile is provided for deploying to Cloud Run. | `glob` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no `Dockerfile` in the project. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. | `glob` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no `.github` directory or any CI/CD configuration in the project. |
| **Monitoring** | Describes a `monitoring.js` middleware and a `logger.js` file using Winston. | `glob` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There are no such files or monitoring configurations in the project. Logging is done via `console.log`. |

### **Audit of: `docs/ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md`**

This document describes deployment procedures for enterprise customers.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The entire document describes on-premise, private cloud, and hybrid deployment options for a self-hosted, PostgreSQL-based application. It includes details on enterprise compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA), support tiers, and pricing. | `firebase.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The project is a serverless Firebase application. None of the described deployment models, infrastructure, compliance certifications, support plans, or pricing structures exist. This document is entirely fictional. |

---

### **Audit of: `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`**

This document describes patterns for handling errors when interacting with the MINOOTS API.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The document provides client-side code examples for advanced error handling patterns like exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation with local fallbacks. | N/A | **Not Applicable** | ⚠️ Misleading | This document is not a description of the project's internal implementation. It's a guide for consumers of the API. While the patterns are valid, the document could be misinterpreted as describing features that MINOOTS provides out-of-the-box (like automatic retries), which it does not. The code examples are for client-side implementation, not a reflection of the project's own code. |
| **Rate Limiting** | The API returns a `retry-after` header. | `functions/middleware/rateLimiter.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `express-rate-limit` library, used by the project, does set this header correctly. |
| **Tier Limit Exceeded** | The error response for tier limits includes an `upgradeUrl`. | `functions/index.js:225` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The code correctly includes the `upgradeUrl` in the JSON response when a tier limit is hit. |

---

### **Audit of: `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`**

This document provides guides for migrating from other timer systems to MINOOTS.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The entire document describes a sophisticated migration framework, including a dedicated Node.js import script (`migration-import.js`), a validation script, a rollback script, and specific migration scripts for `cron`, `node-cron`, and AWS CloudWatch. | `glob` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | None of these scripts or tools exist in the project. The document is a complete fabrication of a non-existent migration ecosystem. |
| **MINOOTS Import Script** | A Node.js SDK exists at `@minoots/timer-sdk`. | `package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | As established previously, no such SDK is defined in the project's dependencies. |
| **Rollback Procedures** | A `DELETE /timers` endpoint exists that can delete multiple timers based on a metadata filter. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no such bulk-delete endpoint. Timers can only be deleted one by one via `DELETE /timers/:id`. |

---

### **Audit of: `docs/MONITORING.md`**

This document describes how to monitor the MINOOTS system.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The entire document describes a sophisticated, self-hosted monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack. It includes detailed configuration files, alert rules, and dashboard queries. | `firebase.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The project is a serverless Firebase application. It does not use Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK. Monitoring is handled by Google Cloud's built-in logging and monitoring tools. This document is completely irrelevant to the actual project. |
| **Metrics Endpoint** | A `/metrics` endpoint exists for Prometheus to scrape. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no `/metrics` endpoint implemented in the code. |
| **Audit Log** | An audit log is available for tracking user actions. | `functions/rbac-system/core/FirestoreSchema.js:233` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The `FirestoreSchema.js` file contains a `logAuditEvent` function, which suggests an audit logging capability. However, it is not exposed via any user-facing API or dashboard as the documentation implies. |

---

### **Audit of: `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`**

This document provides a comprehensive guide to role-based permissions.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System-Level Permissions** | Describes tier-based permissions for features like "advanced webhooks" and "mcp_integration". | `functions/rbac-system/core/RoleDefinitions.js` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The `RoleDefinitions.js` file defines these permissions, and `index.js` checks for `mcp_integration`. However, "advanced webhooks" are not implemented. |
| **Organization-Level Roles** | Detailed definitions of `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EDITOR`, `VIEWER` roles and their permissions. | `functions/rbac-system/core/RoleDefinitions.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `RoleDefinitions.js` file accurately defines these roles and their associated permissions. |
| **Project-Level Permissions** | Describes project-level access control with roles like `owner`, `editor`, `viewer`. | `functions/rbac-system/core/FirestoreSchema.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `FirestoreSchema.js` defines the `access` map for projects, supporting these roles. |
| **Timer-Level Permissions** | Describes timer-level access control based on `createdBy` and an `access` map. | `functions/index.js:111` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `RealTimer` class and its methods correctly handle `createdBy` and `access` for timers. |
| **API Permission Validation** | Describes the permission checking flow using Custom Claims and Firestore. | `functions/middleware/auth.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `authenticateUser` and `requirePermission` middleware functions implement this flow as described. |
| **Privilege Escalation Prevention** | Claims that users cannot assign roles higher than their own. | `functions/rbac-system/core/RoleDefinitions.js` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `RoleManager.canAssignRole` function implements this logic. |
| **Permission Auditing** | Describes an audit log structure and queries for high-privilege users. | `functions/rbac-system/core/FirestoreSchema.js:233` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The `logAuditEvent` function exists, but there is no exposed API endpoint or dashboard for querying these logs as implied by the "Permission Review Queries" section. |
| **Change User Role API** | `PUT /organizations/{orgId}/members/{userId}` endpoint to change a user's role. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is **no** `PUT` endpoint for managing organization members. The only related endpoint is `POST /organizations/:orgId/invite`. |
| **Grant Project Access API** | `POST /projects/{projectId}/access` endpoint to grant project access. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is **no** such endpoint implemented in `index.js`. |
| **Remove Organization Access API** | `DELETE /organizations/{orgId}/members/{userId}` endpoint to remove a user from an organization. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is **no** `DELETE` endpoint for managing organization members. |

### **Audit of: `docs/QUICK_START.md`**

This document provides a quick start guide for new users.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Key Acquisition** | Describes signing up and getting an API key from a dashboard. | N/A | **Unverifiable** | ❓ Unknown | The existence of a user dashboard is not verifiable from the codebase. |
| **Node.js SDK Usage** | Uses `@minoots/timer-sdk` for Node.js. | `sdk/package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The actual SDK package name is `minoots-sdk`, not `@minoots/timer-sdk`. |
| **Deployment Window Use Case** | Uses `on_progress` webhooks with percentage intervals. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `on_progress` event type is fictional. This use case is impossible to implement. |
| **Webhook Setup** | Provides instructions for Slack and Discord webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | The `on_expire` webhook can indeed post to any URL, including Slack and Discord. However, the `data` payload for Slack and Discord is specific to their APIs and not directly handled by MINOOTS. The example implies MINOOTS formats the payload for these services, which it does not. |
| **Claude Agent Integration** | Refers to `minoots/mcp-server` and `mcp_servers.json`. | `mcp/package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `mcp-server` package name is incorrect; it should be `minoots-timer-system`. The `mcp_servers.json` file is actually `claude_desktop_config.json`. |
| **Monitoring & Progress** | `curl` example for `jq .timer.progress` implies `progress` is directly returned by `GET /timers/:id`. | `functions/index.js:111` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `getTimer` function does return `progress`. |
| **Duration Formats** | Claims support for complex formats like `1h 30m` and `1w 2d 3h 30m 45s`. | `functions/index.js:79` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `RealTimer.parseDuration` function only supports single unit formats (e.g., `30s`, `5m`, `2h`, `1d`). It does not parse complex combined formats. |
| **Quick Troubleshooting: API Key Issues** | Suggests `GET /users/me` to test API key. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no `/users/me` endpoint implemented in `index.js`. |
| **Next Steps: SDK Libraries** | Refers to `@minoots/timer-sdk`. | `sdk/package.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | Repeats the incorrect SDK package name. |
| **Next Steps: Community** | Mentions Discord and Forum. | N/A | **Unverifiable** | ❓ Unknown | The existence of a Discord server or forum is not verifiable from the codebase. |
| **Next Steps: Advanced Webhooks** | Claims "Custom retry logic". | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | As established, the webhook implementation has no retry logic. |
| **Speed Run** | Includes `DELETE` endpoint with `TIMER_ID` from previous response. | `functions/index.js:321` | **Verified** | ✅ Accurate | The `DELETE` endpoint exists and works as shown. |
| **Speed Run** | Includes `GET /users/me` to check account status. | `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | Repeats the non-existent `/users/me` endpoint. |

### **Audit of: `docs/SECURITY.md`**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's security architecture and compliance.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Encryption** | Claims TLS 1.3, certificate pinning, HSTS, PFS, AES-256 at rest, field-level encryption, HSMs. | `firebase.json`, `functions/index.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | Firebase handles some encryption (TLS, at-rest), but the project code does not implement certificate pinning, HSTS, PFS, field-level encryption, or HSMs. These are platform features, not application-level implementations. |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Claims MFA (TOTP, SMS, hardware keys, biometrics), API key rotation and scoping, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, SSO integration. | `functions/middleware/auth.js`, `functions/utils/apiKey.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The project uses Firebase Auth (which supports some MFA, but not all listed) and basic API keys. There is no API key rotation, scoping, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, or explicit SSO integration implemented in the code. |
| **Compliance & Certifications** | Claims SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, and CCPA compliance, with specific control areas and audit statuses. | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no evidence in the codebase or project structure to support any of these compliance certifications or the detailed controls described. These are external certifications that require significant organizational effort and audits, not just code. |
| **API Security: Rate Limiting** | Documents specific rate limits (e.g., Free: 60 req/min, 1000 daily). | `functions/middleware/rateLimiter.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The actual rate limits in the code are different (Free: 10 req/min). The "daily limit" for free tier is not implemented as a separate limit from the concurrent timer limit. |
| **API Security: DDoS Protection** | Claims Cloudflare Enterprise, WAF, bot management, geographic blocking. | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | These are external services and configurations not implemented or managed by the project's codebase. |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization** | Claims specific validation rules for `timer_name`, `duration`, `webhook_url` (e.g., HTTPS only, no localhost, payload size). | `functions/index.js` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Minor | Basic validation exists (e.g., duration format), but the detailed rules (max length, allowed chars, XSS protection, webhook URL validation like HTTPS only/no localhost, payload size) are not explicitly implemented in the code. |
| **Monitoring & Incident Response** | Claims real-time alerts, detailed logging (all API requests, auth events, authorization decisions, admin actions), specific log retention periods, and a formal incident response plan. | `functions/index.js`, `functions/rbac-system/core/FirestoreSchema.js` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | Logging is basic `console.log`. There is no detailed logging of all API requests, auth/auth decisions, or admin actions as described. No explicit log retention policies are implemented in code. The incident response plan is a generic template. |
| **Infrastructure Security** | Claims VPC, Cloud NAT, Cloud Armor, COS, binary authorization, Cloud SQL, container/Kubernetes security (network policies, pod security standards, signed images, SBOM). | `firebase.json` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | These are Google Cloud Platform features that Firebase abstracts away or are not configured/implemented by the project's code. The project does not use Kubernetes or Docker. |
| **Security Testing** | Claims annual penetration testing, web application/API security testing, vulnerability management (scanning, patch management). | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no evidence of these security testing practices or tools being integrated or documented within the project's development workflow. |
| **Security Metrics & KPIs** | Claims specific security metrics and dashboards. | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | There is no implementation of these metrics or dashboards in the codebase. |
| **Customer Security Controls** | Claims data residency options, Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), private connectivity (VPC Peering, Cloud Interconnect). | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | These are advanced enterprise features of Google Cloud Platform that are not implemented or offered by the MINOOTS application itself. |
| **Security Awards & Recognition** | Claims SOC 2, ISO 27001, Google Cloud Security Partner, OWASP ASVS Level 2 certifications. | N/A | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | These are external certifications and partnerships that are not verifiable from the codebase and are highly unlikely for a project of this scope. |

### **Audit of: `docs/SLACK_INTEGRATION.md`**

This document describes how to integrate MINOOTS with Slack.

| Section | Claim / Feature Used | Code Location | Verification | Status | Discrepancy Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All** | The document describes client-side code for sending messages to Slack via webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Partially Accurate** | ⚠️ Misleading | The core MINOOTS system only sends a generic JSON payload to a webhook URL. It does not have built-in Slack-specific formatting, rich message attachments, interactive buttons, or thread replies. The examples show what a *client* would send to Slack, not what MINOOTS generates. |
| **Rich Message with Attachments** | Claims MINOOTS can send rich messages with attachments. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | The `on_expire` webhook only sends a simple JSON object. It does not construct Slack-specific rich message formats or attachments. |
| **Progress Notifications** | Relies on `on_progress` webhooks. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | As established, the `on_progress` event type is fictional. This feature is not implemented. |
| **Advanced Slack Features** | Describes interactive buttons, thread replies, and direct messages. | `functions/index.js:154` | **Inaccurate** | ❌ Major | MINOOTS does not have any built-in functionality to generate interactive Slack messages, manage threads, or send direct messages. These are features of the Slack API that a client would implement, not MINOOTS. |
| **Slack Bot Integration** | Provides code for a custom Slack Bot using `@slack/bolt` to respond to `/timer` and `/timer-status` commands. | N/A | **Not Applicable** | ⚠️ Misleading | This section describes a separate application (a Slack Bot) that *uses* the MINOOTS API. It is not part of the MINOOTS codebase itself. The `minoots.timers.create` and `minoots.timers.list` calls would interact with the MINOOTS API, but the bot itself is external. |
| **Team Dashboard Integration** | Describes Slack Workflow Builder integration and channel-specific timers. | N/A | **Unverifiable** | ❓ Unknown | The existence of a "Team Dashboard" is not verifiable from the codebase. The Slack Workflow Builder integration is a conceptual example of how an external tool could use MINOOTS, not a feature of MINOOTS itself. |
