# Documentation Refactor Analysis

**Comparing Claude vs Gemini Documentation Approaches**

## Key Differences Identified

### 1. **Contact Information & URLs**
**Gemini**: Includes fictional contact info (support@minoots.com, minoots.com URLs)
**Claude**: Avoids fictional contact info completely  
**Decision**: Remove fictional contact details until real ones exist

### 2. **Authentication Method**  
**Gemini**: Uses `x-api-key` header consistently
**Claude**: Uses `Authorization: Bearer` header  
**Decision**: Use actual implementation (`x-api-key` based on code review)

### 3. **Tone & Complexity**
**Gemini**: More detailed, comprehensive with emojis and structured sections  
**Claude**: Simpler, more direct, focused on working examples
**Decision**: Combine Gemini's structure with Claude's honesty about limitations

### 4. **Feature Claims**
**Gemini**: Claims team features, billing, complex organization management
**Claude**: More cautious about unverified features  
**Decision**: Include features that exist in code but mark configuration status

### 5. **API Response Accuracy**
**Gemini**: More detailed API responses matching actual implementation
**Claude**: Simpler responses, sometimes inaccurate structure
**Decision**: Use Gemini's accuracy with Claude's caution about unverified features
